## Technical Issues

### HTML and CSS
index.html --> Left side of the screen --> canvas size, scoring and game play<br/>
style.css --> Define style in both sides of the screen<br/>
### JS 
main.js --> all functions (draw canvas, crash, scoring, obstacles raining, time, keys interaction, start game, game over), audio, variables.<br/>
consomer.js --> Player class (speed, img, moving)<br/>
bonus_malus.js --> Obstacles class (rain, crash)<br/>
